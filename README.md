<br/>This app goes through a lot of concepts like adding picture, importing files, rows, columns, etc. in just one file which in a way makes it a lot less complicated.
<br/>Try to build the same app by not just copying and pasting the code but by writing each and every word on your own so that you know exactly whats going on and then you can play around with different packages.
<br/>If you are still not able to understand, search "net ninja flutter id card" and watch the first video.
